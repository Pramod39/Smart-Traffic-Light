# Smart-Traffic-Light
simple effective project-IEA Rasspberry Pi Competition Entry
#Discription

  Some thieves use night to hide  them selves   


 They wait for the red light


 And attack

Now “Smart Traffic Light” will solve this problem
 the light will become green and now no fear from riding alone ,just leave it on us and on material and programming. So just leave it on technology and go smart.
Just ultra-sonic sensor on every road we  can controls the car flow to btter.

Also this project have a lot of more demonstration as:

1-using solar panel as an eco-friendly material
  
2- sensor with statistical report to calculate the number of cars passing through a street so we can calculate a good timer fixed with this street as need.
3-also can put and ultra-sonic sensors for the ambulance road to immediately close the facing street and open its way. So we increase the probability of this person to survive
4-“Nearly 5,338,000  people die in road crashes each year, on average 14624 deaths a day ,and this is also only in United states.”
As this link” http://www.ask.com/business-finance/many-car-accidents-happen-year-6d84cea0a06774ed ” .
Think of it across the whole world.
 So this new project will make it decreases .
5-As MIT News http://news.mit.edu/2014/traffic-lights-theres-a-better-way-0707
“Anyone who has ever driven a city street and been frustrated by having to stop again and again for red lights has probably thought that there must be a better way. Now, researchers at MIT have developed a means of computing optimal timings for city stoplights that can significantly reduce drivers’ average travel times.”
So if this is combined with ours the traffic light will become with no mistakes and error just if we combine every idea together and maybe in future more projects will found another solutions.
Just go smart

Smart traffic Light 


 

Who knew a great idea could be reduced into a very small piece of hardware that could change life as we know it?!
Introducing the raspberry pi
We aspire to ease the way of driving by a program which control traffic lights by the power of ultra-sonic sound sensor.
How?
Using a not-so-complicated codes we can measure different distances for different uses.
